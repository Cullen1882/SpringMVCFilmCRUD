## Spring MVC Film C.R.U.D. Project



## Description

MVC FILM SITE is a functioning application that allows a user to access a film database through a web
interface. The user can search for films already in the database by the film's id or a keyword. The user
can also add a film to the database or update and delete film records. The interface prompts the user
to complete the requested task through the use of forms which have text input fields and dropdown option
menus.


## Lessons Learned

We learned how useful Gradle is when dealing with Databases, and how important it is to 
get the right SQL queries and connect all the key variables correctly to be able
to pull and add data to and from the database.

We struggled with joining the film_category table but after learning how to 
get those keys and use them in our code, helped our understanding of DAO.

Using Gradle was a little different than Maven but helped our understanding of
the moving parts and connections from our DB to our web page.


## Technologies Used

STS, Java, Gradle, HTML, JSP, and Git
