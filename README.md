## Spring MVC Film C.R.U.D. Project



## Description
This is a full functioning website for users to find films by film id, keyword or create, update or delete 
films. 


## Lessons Learned

We learned how useful Gradle is when dealing with Databases, and how important it is to 
get the right SQL queries and connect all the key variables correctly to be able
to pull and add data to and from the database.

We struggled with joining the film_category table but after learning how to 
get those keys and use them in our code, helped our understanding of DAO.

Using Gradle was a little different than Maven but helped our understanding of
the moving parts and connections from our DB to our web page.


## Technologies Used

STS, Java, Gradle, HTML, JSP, and Git
